🎾 Exciting Match Facts  Powered by YOLOV8 Project 🎾

Are you passionate about machine learning, computer vision, and sports analytics? Check out this fascinating project that analyzes Tennis players in action, measuring their speed, ball shot speed, and number of shots using cutting-edge technologies!

🔍 Introduction:
This project delves into Tennis player analysis using advanced techniques. It employs YOLO v8 for player detection, Fine-Tuned YOLO for tennis ball detection, and CNNs for extracting court keypoints, built similarly to Amazon Web Services' (AWS) groundbreaking partnership with Bundesliga for real-time game analysis.

🌐 AWS-Bundesliga Match Facts Inspiration:
Taking inspiration from the AWS and Bundesliga collaboration, this project leverages AWS machine learning and analytics to enhance the fan experience, just like the "Bundesliga Match Facts Powered by AWS" initiative. By delivering real-time insights like Average Positions and xGoals, this project aims to build similar functionality and engagement for Tennis matches.
